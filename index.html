## 🔄 How to update your site later
If you need to make changes (e.g., new dates, perks, or design tweaks):

1. Edit your `index.html` file locally on your computer.  
2. In GitHub, go to your repository and click **Add file → Upload files**.  
3. Upload the updated `index.html` (it will replace the old one).  
4. Commit the changes.

Within a minute or so, GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site with the new version. Refresh the page at your live URL to see the updates.

## 📝 Notes
- The form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to collect responses. You can change the `action` attribute inside `index.html` to your own Formspree endpoint.
- A basic honeypot field is included to prevent spam.
- You can later add Google reCAPTCHA for stronger protection once you have a domain.

💡 Tip: Keep `index.html` in the root of your repository for GitHub Pages to recognize it as your site entry point.
